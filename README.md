## Inspiration
As college students, beyond grinding out work and tedious CS projects, we have spent time together working out every week. Along with this, we buy maybe too many groceries to supplement our bodies that have been worn down and our brains that have been going haywire due to our projects. Unfortunately, admittedly we had to throw out a couple of things due to mold. In a lot of the cases, we tried to eat it and didn’t like it, or we lost motivation in how to cook it. One solution to this is to find a list of unique recipes just based on specific ingredients we want to use before they go bad. Voila, Recipe Genie was born. Allowing you to find recipes based on how accurately they match with the ingredients you have or want to get rid of. 

## What it does
Our program gathers a list of ingredients inputted by the user. It then outputs a few recipes that closely match the ingredients provided, as well as the recipe’s ingredients list and cooking instructions.

## How we built it
We used an API from RapidAPI to scrape the internet for cooking recipes. We figured out a way to give it a list of ingredients and grab a list of recipes based on the list of ingredients. From there, we created a nice graphical user interface using Tkinter that allows the user to select the desired ingredients. Finally we used the Tkinter to display the ingredients and instructions to make each recipe.

## Challenges we ran into
We had many issues with creating the GUI since none of us had prior experience. We spent lots of time finding a good library to build our GUI off of. We also had to learn how to pull information from an API.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of how all the different parts of the program integrated without many issues which allowed our program to work as intended.

## What we learned
Learned how to request information from an API given a list of parameters.
Learned how to use the Tkinter Python graphical library.

## What's next for Recipe Generator
We hope to improve the user GUI as well as transfer the program into a web app. We also want to implement a nutrition section for people to track and decide recipes based on their nutritional needs.
